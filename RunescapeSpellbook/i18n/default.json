	 Hey, if you're looking into this trying to translate it, just a few notes to help out
	 Old school runescape - the mod this is based on - doesn't have any official translations
	 Runescape 3 does though - as far as I can tell it supports German, French, Brazilian Portuguese and (Formerly) Latin American Spanish
	 Unfortunately only Brazilian Portuguese has a wiki translation and I'm unsure how accurate that is.
	 Either way, there might be some things in here that have different canon names per language - for example, all references to alcohol are removed in Brazilian Portuguese.
	 If you're looking to make an accurate translation you might have to look into what these objects are called in Runescape 3 (If they exist there)
